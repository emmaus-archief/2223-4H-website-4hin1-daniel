     <h1 class="LBinfotitle"> What are they?</h1>
     <div class="LBinfotxt"><p> The White Walkers were an ancient race of formerly-human ice creatures who came from the far north of Westeros. After remaining hidden for thousands of years, they returned and were sighted by several sworn brothers of the Night's Watch and countless wildlings. However, most who live south of the Wall believed them to be nothing more than creatures of legend.
<br><br>
The White Walkers were thousands of years old, coming from the time preceding the Age of Heroes. Born of powerful and untested magic, they were created to protect the Children of the Forest from the First Men, who had waged war on them ever since they had arrived from Essos. However, the White Walkers eventually broke free of the Children's control and became the most feared creatures in Westeros, posing a threat to all life.[1]
<br><br>
Eight thousand years before Robert's Rebellion, the longest winter in history fell on the entire world and lasted a whole generation. In the darkness and cold of the "Long Night," the White Walkers descended upon Westeros from the Far North, killing all in their path and reanimating the dead as wights to serve as mindless soldiers in their undead army. The people of Westeros soon realized they had to rally together or the White Walkers would kill them all. In a conflict known as the Battle for the Dawn, the living won a decisive victory and pushed the White Walkers far north to the Lands of Always Winter. With help from giants and the Children of the Forest, the Wall was raised to bar their return. The Night's Watch was founded to guard the Wall and the realms of men should the mysterious threat ever rise again.
<br><br>
The White Walkers have risen again.
<br><br>
Although the White Walkers have faded into legend over the centuries, disturbing reports began to reach the Night's Watch, just before the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings. The return of the White Walkers was confirmed during the Great Ranging undertaken by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, and by an unprecedented attack by the wight army on the wildling settlement of Hardhome.[2] Despite repeated pleas for support from the Night's Watch, the rest of the Seven Kingdoms turned a blind eye to the return of the White Walkers as they remained embroiled in their own civil wars, believing the White Walkers to be purely mythological, much like giants and Children of the Forest, who have also faded into legend.
<br><br>
The ultimate goal of the legendary White Walkers was the end of every living thing in existence, which they planned to achieve by killing the Three-Eyed Raven and creating an endless winter to eclipse the known world. However, their plans were thwarted when Arya Stark killed the Night King at the Battle of Winterfell, resulting in the permanent extinction of the White Walkers and the end of the Great War. </p></div>

   <div class="LBinfo LBtopright">
     <h1 class="LBinfotitle"> Powers</h1>
     <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>White Walkers have a very strong affinity with ice magic and coldness. They are physically far stronger than humans, capable of effortlessly tossing people back tens of feet in the air.[2] Since they are inhuman, White Walkers have no physical restrictions. As such, they do not require food or water and seem to be immune to disease, fatigue, extreme cold and extreme heat. White Walkers are immortal. Their arrival is usually accompanied by blizzards and sudden temperature drops.[2] Because of this, they can spread extreme cold wherever they go. The White Walkers wield swords and spears made from unique ice crystals.
<br><br>
However, one of their most deadly abilities is to reanimate the dead as their servants, known as wights.[2] They are capable of reviving any dead creature as wights, including horses, giants, and even dragons.[5] They cannot, however, revive a corpse into servitude if it has been burned.[3] Once a wight has been created, its eyes turn an icy blue, similar to the White Walkers' own eyes. Wights serve their masters without question.
<br><br>
The Night King, leader of the White Walkers, possesses the ability to change humans into White Walkers.[6] He picks up Craster's son from an icy altar and places an index finger on its cheek, causing the baby's eyes to glow blue and his skin to grow pale, taking on the appearance of the White Walkers. Whether or not this ability extends only to the Night King, all of the White Walkers amongst his caste, or all White Walkers in general is unknown.
<br><br>
During the Massacre at Hardhome, White Walkers are shown to be resistant to fire due to the extreme cold they radiate, which snuffs out any flames in their vicinity.[2] They can also freeze normal weapons they come into contact with, causing them to shatter and break.[2] White Walkers are invulnerable against even highly concentrated dragonfire.[7] It is unknown if they are also immune to wildfire. </p></div>

     <h1 class="LBinfotitle"> Weaknesses</h1>
     <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>The only known weaknesses of White Walkers are weapons made of dragonglass[4] or valyrian steel. Upon being stabbed by dragonglass, a White Walker's body will begin to freeze into ice from the point at which it was stabbed, causing the Walker great pain. Finally, it will begin to crack and fall apart, eventually shattering into ice. Valyrian steel has the same effect, but works much more rapidly. These materials are also resistant to being frozen and shattered on contact with White Walkers, unlike regular weapons.
<br><br>
White Walkers are "glass cannons", possessing incredible strength and power but being very vulnerable. Any injury, no matter how minor or significant from weapons made of dragonglass or valyrian steel, will result in their death and the deaths of all things they have reanimated. Because of this, White Walkers tend to stay behind their undead wights or far away from conflict.
<br><br>
Since the Night King was the first White Walker ever created, his death will cause the death of all other White Walkers, and subsequently, their wights. As such, he is simultaneously the strongest and weakest part of the undead army. </p></div>

   <div class="LBinfo LBbottomright">
     <h1 class="LBinfotitle"> History</h1>
     <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>The White Walkers' origins are a mystery to most humans. Only the ancient Children of the Forest remember the truth of how they came to be.
<br><br>
Over eight thousand years before the War of the Five Kings, the Children of the Forest were locked in a war with the First Men, who had migrated to Westeros from Essos. Despite resorting to powerful magic, which allowed them to flood the Neck and even destroy the land-bridge linking the two continents and reducing it to a chain of islands, the Children were losing ground; more and more of them fell to the First Men and their precious forests were being cut down.
<br><br>
White Walkers' creation
<br><br>
Out of desperation, a small group of Greenseers attempted to create a powerful new weapon against the humans. They bound a captive man to a weirwood and pressed a cursed shard of dragonglass into his heart. The unfortunate captive was transformed into a cold, heartless, deathless creature whose only desire was to consume all life. He would become the progenitor of the White Walker race and lead his kind on a campaign of destruction, not only against humans, but against his creator's as well.[1]
<br><br>
Soon the Children saw that their creation had grown beyond their control, and forged an alliance with the First Men to avoid mutual destruction. In what would become known as the "Battle for the Dawn", the alliance beat the White Walkers back to the far north, where they vanished. This victory led to a lasting truce between the Children and the First Men; the Children would keep their forests, and the Men could keep their farms, towns, and cities. The truce also marked the creation of both the Wall and the Night's Watch, the latter having been armed by the Children with dragonglass blades, in case the Walkers should ever return.</p></div>

  <div class="LBinfo leftDRinfo"> 
    <h1 class="LBinfotitle"> What are they?</h1>
      <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>Dragons are massive, flying reptiles that can breathe fire. They are rumored to have a strong connection to magic, which seems to be proven true when magic begins to return to the world after the birth of the first three in over two hundred years. Dragons possess awesome and devastating power, capable of laying waste to armies and burning entire cities to ashes. Men who were able to tame and ride dragons as beasts of war used them in battle and to forge vast empires across the continents of Essos and Westeros. The greatest of these empires was the Valyrian Freehold forged by the Valyrian dragonlords.
<br><br>
Aegon I Targaryen and his sisters used the last three surviving dragons in the world to conquer and unify the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. For generations, the dragon-kings ruled over much of Westeros - but the dragons eventually died out after nearly a century and a half, and the species was subsequently considered to be extinct.
<br><br>
At the same time that the War of the Five Kings began in Westeros, Daenerys Targaryen was in possession of three petrified dragon eggs. They were given to her as a wedding gift, beautiful to look upon and valuable beyond comprehension, but otherwise useless. However, in a shocking display of old magic, Daenerys miraculously hatched the eggs and for the first time in generations, dragons filled the skies. </p></div>

     <h1 class="LBinfotitle">History</h1>
    <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>The first known dragons were mentioned to have their lairs in the Fourteen Fires, a chain of volcanoes across the neck of the Valyrian peninsula. The Valyrians, then peaceful shepherds, tamed the dragons with magic, even learned how to master and ride them as beasts of war. Thus they began expanding their influence from the Peninsula to the rest of their continent forming the Valyrian Freehold. The dragons gave the decisive victory in the Ghiscari Wars during which the Old Ghis is burned to ashes by dragonfire, and the ever-expanding Freehold replaced the Ghiscari Empire as the dominant culture of Essos. The Rhoynar under Nymeria fled to Dorne having no chance against the Valyrian dragons.
<br><br>
Four hundred years before the War of the Five Kings, the entire Valyrian empire was destroyed in a single day, during a cataclysmic volcanic eruption known as the Doom of Valyria. Most dragons, still lairing in the volcanoes, were killed outright. One Valyrian noble family, the Targaryens, survived the Doom on the distant island outpost of Dragonstone in the Narrow Sea - along with the last surviving Valyrian dragons.
<br><br>
The last surviving dragons in the world were possessed by House Targaryen, the last Valyrians after the Cataclysm, who used them to conquer and unify the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros three hundred years before the War of the Five Kings. Most of the Targaryen dragons died in a civil war known as Dance of the Dragons about a century and a half later, and after that, the only dragons the Targaryens had were the size of cats. Soon after the civil war ended, the last Targaryen dragons died, and the species was considered to be extinct throughout the world. </p></div>

  <div class="LBinfo rightDRinfo">
     <h1 class="LBinfotitle"> Biology</h1>
      <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>Dragons have long serpentine bodies, with proportionately long necks and tails. Their bodies have four limbs: two short back legs and two large wings as forelimbs, a body-plan similar to a bat. In later generations, after the dragons went extinct, physical descriptions of dragons became so confused in memory that artwork sometimes depicted them as having six limbs - two wings growing out of their backs in addition to four legs - but this is inaccurate, at least in Westerosian legend. The teeth and claws of adult dragons are as long and sharp as swords.
<br><br>
Dragons are covered in scales, as well as spines that run down their backs from head to tail. Particularly large ridges of horns frame the edges of their faces, running along the back of the skull and along the jawline, which grow bigger as they mature. Adult dragons possess two sets of frills that run along the backs of their necks and spine, two along the sides of their necks and another two centered closer to the backbone, for a total of four frills. These are formed from webbing that grows between longer spines. When dragons are agitated (or simply excited), they raise and flare these frills - similar to how a furry animal like a cat will raise the hackles on its back when agitated (or a feathered animal such as a goose will puff up its feathers), in an attempt to appear bigger so as to intimidate its enemies.
<br><br>
Dragons are also shown to have a variety of calls, from shrieking roars to low growls or hisses. They can even squeal.
<br><br>
Dragons are obligate carnivores, with diets consisting entirely of meat. Dragons need to roast their prey with their fire-breath before consuming it - the only animals apart from humans who prefer cooked meat. Dragons can eat almost any kind of meat, anything from sheep to fish. Historical dragons ridden as beasts of war were known to eat fallen horses and even men on the battlefield. Fully grown dragons could swallow a live horse whole. </p></div>

  <div class="LBinfo rightDRinfo">
     <h1 class="LBinfotitle"> Training and Riding</h1>
      <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>Dragons cannot be truly "tamed", but they can be bonded with and trained. Humble Valyrian shepherds were the first to control them using magic, and rode dragons for millennia. Aegon I Targaryen and his sister-wives, who descended from Old Valyria, used the last three dragons in the world to conquer and unify the Seven Kingdoms.
<br><br>
Dragons are fairly intelligent animals, and like a horse or a dog, they can be trained by their rider to respond to basic voice commands. Tyrion Lannister claims that dragons are intelligent, much more so than most people and will quickly recognize friend from foe. If they are not trained they will quickly lay waste to anything around them. The key to training dragons is making sure they are well-fed, a dragon with a full stomach is more obedient.
<br><br>
Since they cannot be truly tamed, dragons can be very dangerous even to their riders. However, they can form very strong bonds with their riders and will show affection and trust towards them. They will even nuzzle their riders, hoping to be petted.
<br><br>
Daenerys Targaryen has trained her three dragons to respond to vocal commands in her mother tongue of High Valyrian. She often uses the command "Dracarys", to which her dragons respond by instantly breathing fire and burning anything in their path. </p></div>

   <div class="LBinfo LBtopleft">
     <h1 class="LBinfotitle"> What are they?</h1>
     <div class="LBinfotxt"><p> The Children of the Forest are a mysterious non-human race who were reportedly the original inhabitants of the continent of Westeros. They were already living in Westeros when the First Men migrated to the continent, 12,000 years before Robert's Rebellion.[1]
<br><br>
According to legend they were last seen during the Andal Invasion 6,000 years before the War of the Five Kings. In the present day, most believe that they are simply the stuff of myth and never existed at all. Even the few who do believe they once existed, such as Maester Luwin or Ned Stark, believe that they have long since gone extinct. In actual fact, some of the Children endured for a time Beyond the Wall as one group of Children came to serve the Three-Eyed Raven. This group was eventually killed during an assault on the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven, rendering the Children seemingly extinct.  </p></div>
   </div>

    
   <div class="LBinfo LBtopright">
     <h1 class="LBinfotitle"> Biology</h1>
     <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>The Children of the Forest were a sapient species that resembled humans in overall shape but significantly smaller in stature, with adults being no larger than human children. Their facial anatomy is mostly identical to that of a human albeit being very rounded and soft, like that of a young child. They also have disproportionately large and expressive eyes (like human babies), which are set wider in their face than would be normal for a human child of the same height and stature.
<br><br>
Their skin is shown to be a pale gray-green with an apparent rough to wrinkly tecture, similar in appearence to plants. Similarly, their eyes have been shown to be all lime green in color. Like humans, the Children of the Forest do possess hair, however, they only possess hair on their head and lack eyebrows and body hair. The Children of the Forest also seem to possess an indigo-colored blood.
<br><br>
A notable difference in anatomy is that the Children of the Forest are tetradactyl, possessing only four digits on each of their hands.
<br><br>
They also seem to be extremely long-lived. Given Leaf participated in the creation of the Night King some twelve thousand years ago, their lifespans are clearly measured in millennia. It is unknown if this is through purely-magical or biological means or a combination of both. </p></div>

     <h1 class="LBinfotitle"> Culture</h1>
     <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>The Children of the Forest worshiped nature gods, the countless and nameless spirits of every tree, every rock, and every stream. Their religion devoted to the Old Gods of the Forest had no complex temples, but according to legend it was the Children who carved faces into the sacred weirwood trees. These carved heart trees were the closest thing to a shrine in their religion.
<br><br>
The Children of the Forest weren't very technologically advanced, though they were skilled at woodcraft and had a great knowledge of the plants and animals of the forest. They hunted using bows made of weirwood and used blades made of dragonglass.
<br><br>
The shamans of the Children of the Forest were known as "Greenseers", who are said to have had impressive powerful magic at their disposal.  </p></div>
   </div>

    
   <div class="LBinfo LBbottomright">
     <h1 class="LBinfotitle"> History</h1>
     <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>Legend holds that the Children of the Forest ruled Westeros for thousands of years before the arrival of the first humans on the continent twelve millennia ago. They inhabited the vast primeval forests which spanned most of Westeros before humans came and began cutting them down. According to legend, the giants also inhabited Westeros at this time, and clashed periodically with the Children. Whatever history, wars, romances, or triumphs the Children may have had in the untold centuries that they inhabited Westeros, their stories have been forgotten.
<br><br>
Twelve thousand years ago, the First Men from the eastern continent of Essos migrated to Westeros by crossing a land bridge known as the Arm of Dorne. The First Men began cutting down the Children's forests, including the sacred weirwood trees, leading them into conflict with the Children. The two races fought a desperate series of wars for dominance for the next two thousand years, during which the Children of the Forest destroyed the Arm of Dorne and flooded the Neck through the sorcery of their greenseers.
<br><br>
After two thousand years of violence, the Children of the Forest and the First Men fought one another to a standstill. The two races agreed to peaceful coexistence and signed the Pact on the Isle of Faces in Gods Eye lake, granting the open lands to humanity and the forests to the Children.
<br><br>
The Pact lasted for another two thousand years before the enigmatic White Walkers invaded from the uttermost north, bringing death and destruction to both races. The Children of the Forest allied with the First Men to drive back the White Walkers in the War for the Dawn eight thousand years ago. After the defeat of the White Walkers, the Children, much-reduced in number, are said to have helped Bran the Builder raise the Wall with their powerful magic to prevent the White Walkers' return.
<br><br>
The Children of the Forest never had a large population to begin with, and they took heavy losses in the struggle against the White Walkers, from which they never truly recovered. Over the following centuries they gradually declined throughout Westeros, until they had all but disappeared by the time the Andals invaded Westeros six thousand years ago. </p></div>

<h1 class="LBtitle"> Direwolf</h1>

    
<div class="LBleftside">
  
  <div class="LBinfo leftDRinfo"> 
    <h1 class="LBinfotitle"> behind the scenes</h1>
      <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>    In Season 1, the production team used adult dogs to stand in for the juvenile direwolf puppies. Northern Inuit (Utonagan) Dogs from Mahlek Kennels were used.[3] In interviews they have stated that this was done to allow the audience to grow attached to them, which would have been more difficult had the dogs been created by special effects. As the direwolves continue to grow, however, more special effects are going to be used.
        <br><br>
    When Season 1 wrapped up, the dogs used as direwolves were offered to the young actors who played their owners in the show. Sophie Turner (Sansa) took the dog who played Lady. Isaac Hempstead-Wright (Bran) wanted to take Summer, but his family already had two dogs at home.
        <br><br>
    In Season 2, real wolves were used to portray the adolescent direwolves. Using a variety of camera tricks and techniques, the shots were augmented to make the wolves appear larger, and then composited with the background and actors for the final shots. The result is that in Season 2 the direwolves are played by real-life wolves that have been super-sized in post-production.[4]
        <br><br>
    In Season 5, Ghost is the only direwolf that appears. Since he is supposed to be older and larger, the production team wanted to use a full-sized trained wolf named Quigley to portray him (in "The Wars To Come" and "The Gift"). Quigley's trainer Andrew Simpson owns about 30 wolves and is based in Calgary, Canada. The production team had been reaching out to him since Season 1, but he was busy training wolves for other film projects. In earlier seasons, they had hoped to have one of his wolves transported to Northern Ireland, but by Season 5 they decided it would be easier to simply fly out to Canada to film the scenes they needed with the wolf in a Calgary studio.[5]
        <br><br>
    It wasn't possible to translate "dire wolf" into German, so the species was named "Schattenwolf" in the German dub, meaning "shadow wolves" [6]. This name was possibly chosen because there's also an animal species in Westeros called shadowcats. </p></div>

     <h1 class="LBinfotitle">Range</h1>
    <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>Direwolves are held to be near-mythical in most of the south of Westeros. Inhabitants of the North acknowledge that they are a real animal, but they are very rarely encountered there. There are some rumors of them living in the Wolfswood near Winterfell, but these are unconfirmed. There may have been larger direwolf populations in the North in past millennia, but centuries of human encroachment on their territory have pushed their range back to the furthest north.
<br><br>
There have been confirmed sightings north of the Wall by the Night's Watch who guard it. The wildlings who live beyond the Wall claim that direwolves can be found in greater numbers in the Haunted Forest to the north of the Wall. By the reign of King Robert Baratheon, no direwolf had been sighted south of the Wall - even in the Stark lands of the North - in over 200 years.
<br><br>
Eddard Stark and his sons Robb and Bran, his "bastard" son Jon Snow and his ward Theon Greyjoy find a dead female direwolf; it died after giving birth, and her five pups huddle by the corpse for warmth. Eddard advocates killing the pups out of mercy, but Jon convinces his "father" that this is an omen: the direwolf is the symbol of House Stark, and Eddard has five trueborn children. Eddard agrees that his children can have the pups, but only if they raise them themselves with no help from the servants. Just as the party leaves, Jon finds a sixth pup, an albino runt of the litter. Theon mockingly points out that this one belongs to Jon.
<br><br>
When Eddard travels south to King's Landing to serve as Hand of the King, he brings his daughters Sansa and Arya along with their pet direwolves, Lady and Nymeria. These are the first direwolves to be seen so far south in hundreds of years. After Nymeria attacks Prince Joffrey, Arya drives her away to escape execution for attacking Joffrey; in her place, Lady is killed by Eddard at Robert's command. Nymeria has been traveling the Riverlands ever since where she leads a pack of gray wolves.
<br><br>
The other direwolves remain with their masters until they are killed, with the exception of Jon's direwolf Ghost, who is still alive and by Jon's side.  </p></div>

<div class="LBrightside">

  <div class="LBinfo rightDRinfo">
     <h1 class="LBinfotitle"> Biology&Behavior</h1>
      <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>An adult direwolf is as large as a small horse, and can rip a man's arm from its socket. Even a juvenile direwolf is quite capable of killing a man by ripping out his throat. Physically, they are not simply larger versions of wolves, but have slightly different proportions than their smaller cousins; their heads are larger with a leaner, more pronounced muzzle, their legs are longer in proportion to their body, and they have proportionately larger teeth that are often used to crush bones. They are typically gray to almost black, sometimes with a lighter underbody or reddish tints. Some are light gray and white or reddish tan or mixed red and gray. A few are true albinoes. They mostly have golden to green eyes with some having hazel, amber or albino red irises.
        <br><br>
Direwolves are loyal to their masters and will attack anyone who threatens them. Arya's direwolf Nymeria attacked Joffrey after he threatened her with a sword, while Bran's Summer killed a would-be assassin in Bran's bedroom.[1] They will also come to the aid of those they know are loyal to their masters, since Ghost defended Samwell Tarly and Gilly, both friends of Jon, from Night's Watch bullies, and later prepared to fight alongside Davos Seaworth, Eddison Tollett and a handful of Jon's loyal brothers against the Night's Watch mutineers who betrayed and murdered Jon not long before.
<br><br>
At the Battle of Oxcross during the War of the Five Kings, Robb's direwolf Grey Wind plays a vital part in Robb's victory, killing several Lannister sentries and panicking their horses.[2] During the Battle of Castle Black, Ghost killed numerous wildlings, among them at least one Thenn</p></div>

      <div class="LBinfotxt"><p>   alive:<br><br> Ghost, adopted by Jon. One of the only surviving direwolves. An albino with red eyes and the runt of the litter. Ghost followed Jon during his service with the Night's Watch at the Wall and beyond. Fought at Winterfell against the Army of the Dead during the Battle of Winterfell. Lost his ear and received a few scars in the latter war. Currently travelling north of Castle Black with Jon and Tormund.<br><br>
    Nymeria, adopted by Arya. One of the only surviving direwolves. Fearing for Nymeria's life, Arya chased her away after she attacked Joffrey to defend her owner. She is now leading a wolf pack in the Riverlands, being the first direwolf seen that far south (other than Grey Wind) in many centuries.

Deceased:<br><br>

    Lady: adopted by Sansa Stark. Put down by Eddard in place of Nymeria for biting Joffrey, under the order of Robert, at Cersei Lannister's urging. Lady is the first direwolf of her litter to have been killed.<br><br>
    Grey Wind, adopted by Robb. Accompanied the main Stark army as it marched south, used by King Robb as a ferocious war dog. Killed at the Twins by Frey men with crossbows during the Red Wedding, after which both he and Robb were decapitated and his head sewn onto Robb's corpse.
